This repository provides the open-source code to the following Paper:

The novel Megawatt Charging System standard 
//  Implications on battery size and cell requirements for battery-electric long-haul trucks

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etran.2023.100253

Following contributions of the mentioned paper, are provided by this repo:

- Novel investigation of the impact of varying operating
strategies and charging powers up to 3.75 MW on the
required battery size
This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
charging powers up to 3.75MW, possible with the novel
MCS standard, in terms of downsizing the battery. Next
to the standard 1-stop-strategy, multiple-stop-strategies are
considered and evaluated.

- Quantification of the resulting cell properties needed
to achieve payload-, volume-, lifetime and TCO parity
with a DT
To enable a quantification tor the potential of the downsizing
of the battery, an analysis of the cell properties, which
are required to achieve the same performance as a state of
the art DT, is conducted.

- Comparison of state of the art cells with the required
cell properties
To evaluate the feasibility of resulting cell properties, they
are compared to two state of the art automotive cells of
different chemistries.
